# How to use the front

## On the interface you will find on the top left (just after the logo) a toggle switch and an dropdown option list
- The default option is to use the API (Backend)
- If you want to swap between users, use to dropdown option list
- You can swap between API and MOCK clicking on the toggle button as much as you want
- Once in Mock, its the saved data from the JSON file that are used (you can be sure of this by pressing ```CTRL+C``` on your BackEnd code terminal to shut down the backend
- Then once you switch to API, the code Error 404 will appear
